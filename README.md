# COMP7860 Project Repository

This repository is used to save all the working files and results for the COMP7860 Project. 

Please check the following on how each folder is structured: 

1. Code 

   Notebook 1: This notebook is used to extract the token transaction data from the Kaggle dataset. This notebook needs to be run in Kaggle. (A Google Cloud project is needed before running the Bigquery) 
   
   Notebook 2: This notebook is used to calculate all network features and test the significance of each observation. 
   
   Notebook 3: This notebook is used to merge the network feature data from notebook 1 with the economic variables and TVL data. 
   
   Notebook 4: This notebook is used to perform the regression analysis between the level of decentralization and market return/volatility.

This folder has two dataset: the first one is the raw transaction data directly from Kaggle, the second one is the processed token transaction data. 

3. Outputs_Data 

This folder has all the intermediate outputs. For each of the output, you can find the original script in the notebook. 

4. Output_Plots

This folder has all the graphs which we generated for all three main results. Each of these outputs can also be found in the notebook. 

5. Paper 

This folder has the original paper which we replicate in this project.
